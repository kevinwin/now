  <h1>What's I'm doing now</h1>
  <p>I'm currently in San Francisco working on the Investment Management team at MyVest. </p>
  <p>My 3 major goals fall into 3 buckets:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Programming. Self-studying core computer science concepts. Playing with Udacity's nanodegrees on the suggestion of a work colleague</li> 
    <li>Finance. One of my targets for this year is a 1 year cache of savings. I'm also learning about the markets and investigating trading.</li>
    <li>Physical fitness. 5 pullups. 20 pistols. 50 pushups.</li>
  </ul>
