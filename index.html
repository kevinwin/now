    <h1>What I'm doing now</h1>
  </header>
  <p>I'm currently working remotely as front-end software engineer on the Investment Management team at <a href="https://myvest.com" >MyVest</a>. </p>
  <p>My 3 major goals fall into 3 buckets:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Programming. Go deep on front-end and wide on other aspects of engineering (computer architecture, networking, math, machine learning)</li> 
    <li>Finance. Save 100 - 200k to pay off a family mortgage and for a downpayment on house.  I'm also learning about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</li>
    <li>Physical fitness. 5 pullups. 20 pistols. 50 pushups.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Outside of these goals I want to spend more time figuring out the answer to these 3 questions:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Where do I want to be?</li>
      <li>Who do I want to be surrounded by?</li>
      <li>What do I want to be doing with my time?</li>
  </ul>
