  <h1>What's I'm doing now</h1>
  <p>I'm currently in San Francisco working on the Investment Management team at <a href="https://myvest.com" >MyVest</a>. </p>
  <p>My 3 major goals fall into 3 buckets:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Programming. <a href="http://nand2tetris.org/">Nand2Tetris - Building a Modern Computer from First Principles</a></li> 
    <li>Finance. One of my targets for this year is a 1 year cache of savings. I'm also learning about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</li>
    <li>Physical fitness. 5 pullups. 20 pistols. 50 pushups.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Outside of these goals I want to spend more time figuring out the answer to these 3 questions:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Where do I want to be?</li>
      <li>Who do I want to be surrounded by?</li>
      <li>What do I want to be doing with my time?</li>
  </ul>
